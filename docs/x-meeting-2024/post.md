I'm happy to announce a big achievement in my academic journey. As a participant at the "X-Meeting 2024: 20º Congresso Brasileiro de Bioinformática", I presented the work "BtBank: A Web Platform for Streamlining Bacillus thuringiensis Protein Prospecting" (https://lorranavf.github.io/btbank/) and I had the honor of winning the Best Software demonstration award.

This is my first doctoral project, and as a participant, I received valuable insights that I intend to implement. The development of this project was made possible through the collaboration between the Applied Computing Laboratory and the Central Molecular Biology Laboratory at the Federal University of Lavras. I would like to express my gratitude to Luiz, Giselly Batista Alves, Renato, Joaquim, and LUCIANO PAIVA for believing in the project and for the numerous meetings and feedback.

I am grateful for all contributions. This award is a motivation for always seeking excellence and innovation in our projects.

A special thank you to Kalynka and Fapemig for helping me secure the necessary funding to participate in the event.
