# First introduces yourself
Hi, my name is Lorrana. I'm going to present a demonstration of the software
that I developed with my colleagues and professors at the Federal University of
Lavras. The software, entitled BtBank, aims to help researchers who work with
the process of prospecting Bacillus thuringiensis strains and toxins against 
specific targets, such as insects, which is the main application of this technology.


# Second, demonstrate the workflow.
Bt-based products rely on the discovery of new toxins, and this process can be challenging. However, BtBank aims to help researchers track the entire process. The workflow of prospecting toxins starts with the collection of samples, isolation, and storage of Bt strains. Then, the strains are grown in culture, and the proteins are extracted and purified for the analysis of protein profiles in both the vegetative and sporulation phases, along with the characterization of the crystals produced during the sporulation phase. Next, bioassays are performed to determine the toxicity of the strains against specific targets. Finally, the strains are sequenced, and the toxins are identified, allowing the development of products based on strains or toxins.

# Then, introduce the software
It was developed in Python, the micro web framework Flask was used for backend development, and the frontend was built using mainly HTML and some of JavaScript. The Platform storage is managed by a PostgreSQL database. These components are containerized using Docker, which allows the software to be easily deployed in different environments. BtBank addresses the need for a centralized platform that integrates multiple stages of the prospecting process, from sample collection to toxin identification. The platform provides a range of functionalities, including user management with role-based access control, data registration for samples, isolates, protein profiles, bioassays, sequencing data, toxins, and targets. Furthermore, BtBank features a comprehensive logging system to track user actions, ensuring data integrity and accountability.

# And Demonstrate the software

# Conclusions
Future developments aim to enhance the platform by implementing a knowledge base process, automated pipelines, and an interactive map of sample collection regions. In summary, BtBank is a valuable tool for researchers studying Bacillus thuringiensis in the field of pesticidal protein prospecting. The software offers a user-friendly interface, robust data management capabilities, and the potential to drive discoveries that benefit agricultural sustainability and pest control efforts. By centralizing data and streamlining workflows, BtBank enables researchers to efficiently explore the diverse repertoire of pesticidal proteins produced by Bt strains, thereby contributing to advancements in sustainable pest management strategies.
